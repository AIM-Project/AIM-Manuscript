    "### Description of the ALL/AML Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Acute Lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), also called Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, is a cancer that starts from the early version of white blood cells called lymphocytes in the bone marrow. The term \"acute\" means that the leukemia can progress quickly, and if not treated in time, would probably be fatal within a few months. Lymphocytic means it develops from early(immature) forms of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. It is different from acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which develops in other blood cell types found in the bone marrow. Using machine learning method, we could classify the two types of leukemia quickly with high accuracy and a lot of work have been done around this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias by Golub et al.(1999)[1]. They proposed a class discovery procedure automatically distinguish between AML and ALL without previous knowledge of these classes. That paper is also the origin of the famous Golub Gene expression dataset. After that, tons of work have used this dataset to verify their feature selections procedures, classifiers etc., which are summarized in the tables above.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two datasets in the paper, training data and test data. The Golub Gene expression dataset contains both of them and also one merged dataset of those two. The traning data consisted of 38 bone marrow samples (27 ALL, 11 AML) obtained from acute leukemia patients at the time of diagnosis. There are 7129 probes in the experiment for 6817 genes, i.e. there are 7129 gene expressions for 6817 genes in the dataset. The test data is an independent collection of 34 leukemia samples with 24 bone marrow and 10 peripheral blood samples. 20 of them are ALL samples and the rest are AML samples. More details about the dataset could be found in the paper 1 or in this linked discription [golubEsets](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/manuals/golubEsets/man/golubEsets.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the range of the gene expression in the dataset is large and there are lots of negative gene expression values, usually several transformation would be done before building the classifier. In paper 2, they manually restricted the value to above some positive threshold and did a log transformation after that. Paper 9 proposed a transformation procedure, which is widely used by researcher afterwards. They did three preprocessing steps: thresholding, filtering and base 10 logarithmic transformation and then reduced the whole training and test dataset to have only 3571 predictors.([dataset](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spikeslab/spikeslab.pdf)) However, after preprocessing use the procedure, we will left with 3051 predictors and that resulting dataset is available at [library/package](http://faculty.mssm.edu/gey01/multtest/multtest-manual.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the dataset has more predictors than observations, the focus of research on the dataset is not restrict to finding an effective classifiers but also the feature selection criterions. In the origin paper, they use a 50-gene classifiers selected by correlation. Lots of other criterions and classifiers are studied by other researchers in the later papers and we will try to reproduce them in our study."
