# AIM-Manuscript contains supporting documents for the manuscript \"Defining the AIM: An Abstraction for Improving Machine Learning Prediction\"

## Project Description:
We present code, data, and supplementary figures and documents used in the preparation of the manuscript \"Defining the AIM: An Abstraction for Improving Machine Learning Prediction\". We illustrate the need for abstraction describing Machine Learning pipelines to facilitate the comparison, improvement, and study of ML results by focusing on the famous ALL/AML dataset \[[1](https://github.com/AIM-Project/AIM-Manuscript/blob/master/LiteratureSearch/Articles/paper1.pdf)\]. We define an abstraction layer for leaderboard style competitions to improve ML results. 

## Repo Folder Contents:
- LiteratureSearch\
This folder contains two notebooks, one giving the results of our literature analysis (LiteratureSearchResults.ipynb) and the other presenting ML pipelines for the articles (SummaryofMLpipelines.ipynb).
- ReproducingMLpipelines\
This folder contains 12 notebooks, 5 for each article we studied in depth, 5 for the comparison of the articles\' methods (Table 1 in the manuscript), and 2 for comparison summaries. We also included the intermediate .Rdata file we created in the folder.

- [Data in Golub. Paper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/golubEsets.html):The datasets used in the Golub. Paper with training dataset(38 by 7129) and testing dataset(34 by 7129).
- [Data Version 2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spikeslab):`leukemia` data in R package spikeslab(72 by 3571). We have shown that this data is a transformed data based on the original data.
- [Data Version 3](http://faculty.mssm.edu/gey01/multtest/): `golub` data in R package multtest. In which, `golub` is the training dataset(38 by 3051) and `golub.cl` is the testing dataset(34 by 3051). We also have shown that this data is another transformed data based on the original data.
- We use the [Data in Golub. Paper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/golubEsets.html) to reprocude most of the paper. However, if the reproduced paper is based on Data Version 2 or Data Version 3, we will use the corresponding data.
