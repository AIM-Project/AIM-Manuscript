# Example

This is a example (using paper1) for how the pipeline looks like. PPFS and Classifier together form a simple pipeline of machine learning algorithm.

## Preprocessing anid Feature Selection(PPFS)
This notebook is for prerprocessing the data and do feature selection for building classifiers later.
## Classifier
This notebook is for building classifiers.
## GolubData
A R data file include all our data.
